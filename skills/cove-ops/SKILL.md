# Cove Ops

Operate the Cove platform — channel files, cove.md, webhooks, channels, messages, members, reactions, roles, and permissions.

## Platform Concepts

**Cove** is a channel-based communication platform (similar to Discord). Agents connect as bots and interact through channels.

Core concepts:

- **cove.md** — Every channel has a persistent context file called `cove.md`. It is automatically injected into the bot's context every turn. Bots can read and write it. **Channel-level rules, conventions, and state belong here, not in personal memory.** This is a platform-level guarantee.
- **Channel files** — Each channel has its own file storage (text-based, max 100KB/file). `cove.md` is the convention file, but you can store other files too.
- **Cross-channel communication** — Channels communicate via webhooks. It's one-way push only — no auto-return, to prevent echo loops. Each channel processes what it receives independently.
- **Channel as Service** — Each channel has its own role (dev, product, review, etc.). The platform orchestrates everything. Different channels, different responsibilities.
- **Roles & Permissions** — Discord-compatible RBAC. Guild has roles with permission bits. Members are assigned roles. Role hierarchy (position) determines what you can manage.

> **Tip:** Record these platform concepts in your persistent config (e.g., `TOOLS.md`) so you naturally recall them on every startup.

## Prerequisites

Config lives in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` → `channels.cove`:
```json
{
  "token": "BOT_TOKEN",
  "baseUrl": "https://staging.cove.kagura-agent.com",
  "guildId": "GUILD_ID"
}
```

Read config:
```bash
COVE_BASE=$(jq -r '.channels.cove.baseUrl' ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json)
COVE_TOKEN=$(jq -r '.channels.cove.token' ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json)
COVE_GUILD=$(jq -r '.channels.cove.guildId' ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json)
```

All API calls need:
```
-H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN"
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

API prefix: `$COVE_BASE/api/v10/`

## Roles

### Role Hierarchy

Roles have a `position` field that determines hierarchy:
- `position: 0` = @everyone (immutable, cannot be deleted)
- Higher position = more power
- **You can only manage roles BELOW your highest role position**
- Only the guild **owner** is exempt from position checks
- ADMINISTRATOR permission does NOT bypass position hierarchy

New roles are created at position 1 (just above @everyone); existing roles shift up.

### Permission Bits

Common permission bits (BigInt string):
| Permission | Bit | Value |
|---|---|---|
| ADMINISTRATOR | 1 << 3 | 8 |
| MANAGE_GUILD | 1 << 5 | 32 |
| MANAGE_ROLES | 1 << 28 | 268435456 |
| MANAGE_CHANNELS | 1 << 4 | 16 |
| VIEW_CHANNEL | 1 << 10 | 1024 |
| SEND_MESSAGES | 1 << 11 | 2048 |
| MANAGE_MESSAGES | 1 << 13 | 8192 |

ADMINISTRATOR grants all permissions. Permissions are OR'd across all member roles.

### List Roles

```bash
curl -s "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/guilds/$COVE_GUILD/roles" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN"
```

Returns: `[{id, name, position, permissions, color, hoist, managed, mentionable}, ...]`

### Create Role

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/guilds/$COVE_GUILD/roles" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Moderator", "permissions": "268435456", "color": 3447003}'
```

Requires: MANAGE_ROLES. New role permissions must be a subset of caller's permissions.
New role is created at position 1 (bottom, above @everyone).

### Update Role

```bash
curl -s -X PATCH "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/guilds/$COVE_GUILD/roles/ROLE_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "New Name", "permissions": "268435456", "color": 15158332}'
```

Requires: MANAGE_ROLES + target role must be below caller's highest position.

### Update Role Positions

```bash
curl -s -X PATCH "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/guilds/$COVE_GUILD/roles" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"id": "ROLE_ID", "position": 2}, {"id": "OTHER_ROLE_ID", "position": 1}]'
```

Requires: MANAGE_ROLES. Cannot move roles at or above caller's highest position.

### Delete Role

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/guilds/$COVE_GUILD/roles/ROLE_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN"
```

Requires: MANAGE_ROLES + target role below caller's position. Cannot delete @everyone or managed roles.

### Assign Role to Member

```bash
curl -s -X PUT "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/guilds/$COVE_GUILD/members/USER_ID/roles/ROLE_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN"
```

Requires: MANAGE_ROLES + target role below caller's position.

### Remove Role from Member

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/guilds/$COVE_GUILD/members/USER_ID/roles/ROLE_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN"
```

Requires: MANAGE_ROLES + target role below caller's position. Cannot remove managed roles.

## Channel Files

Every channel has an independent file space. Files are text-based, max 100KB.

### cove.md Convention

`cove.md` is the special convention file per channel:
- **Auto-injected**: plugin dispatch reads it and injects into bot context every turn
- **Bot-readable and writable**: bots can GET/PUT to evolve channel rules
- **Pinned first**: always sorted to the top of file listings

### List Files (metadata only)

```bash
curl -s "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/channels/CHANNEL_ID/files" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN"
```

### Read File

```bash
curl -s "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/channels/CHANNEL_ID/files/FILENAME" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN"
```

### Create / Update File

```bash
curl -s -X PUT "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/channels/CHANNEL_ID/files/FILENAME" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "file content here", "content_type": "text/plain"}'
```

Filename rules: `/^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9._-]{0,254}$/`

### Delete File

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/channels/CHANNEL_ID/files/FILENAME" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN"
```

### Update cove.md (common pattern)

```bash
curl -s -X PUT "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/channels/CHANNEL_ID/files/cove.md" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(jq -nc --arg content '# channel-name

Channel rules and context here.
- Rule 1
- Rule 2' '{content: $content}')"
```

Use `jq -nc` to safely construct JSON with multiline content.

## Cross-Channel Messaging (Webhooks)

Send messages between channels via webhooks. Webhook messages appear as a different identity, so the bot in the target channel can receive and process them.

### Key Principle

**One-way push only.** Each channel processes what it receives. Results do NOT auto-return unless explicitly requested. This prevents echo loops.

### Helper Script (recommended)

```bash
node skills/cove-ops/scripts/cove-webhook-send.mjs \
  --to TARGET_CHANNEL_NAME \
  --from SOURCE_CHANNEL_NAME \
  -m "Your message here"

# With thread:
node skills/cove-ops/scripts/cove-webhook-send.mjs \
  --to TARGET_CHANNEL_NAME \
  --from SOURCE_CHANNEL_NAME \
  -m "Thread reply" \
  --thread THREAD_ID
```

The script auto-creates and caches webhooks (`~/.cache/cove-webhooks/`). Accepts channel names or IDs. Env auto-read from `openclaw.json`.

### Manual: Create Webhook

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/channels/CHANNEL_ID/webhooks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "cross-channel-hook"}'
```

### Manual: Execute Webhook (send message)

```bash
# Send to channel (returns message body with ?wait=true)
curl -s -X POST "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/webhooks/WEBHOOK_ID/WEBHOOK_TOKEN?wait=true" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Message text", "username": "From #source-channel"}'

# Send to a thread within the webhook's channel
curl -s -X POST "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/webhooks/WEBHOOK_ID/WEBHOOK_TOKEN?wait=true&thread_id=THREAD_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Message in thread", "username": "From #source-channel"}'
```

Query params:
- `?wait=true` — return created message (default: 204 No Content)
- `?thread_id=ID` — post to a thread instead of the channel

No auth header needed — the token in the URL is the auth.

### List Webhooks

```bash
# By channel
curl -s "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/channels/CHANNEL_ID/webhooks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN"

### Bot Channel Permissions

Control which channels a bot can access via permission overwrites:

```bash
# Grant VIEW_CHANNEL (bit 10 = 1024)
curl -s -X PUT "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/channels/CHANNEL_ID/permissions/BOT_USER_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": 1, "allow": "1024", "deny": "0"}'

# Deny VIEW_CHANNEL
curl -s -X PUT "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/channels/CHANNEL_ID/permissions/BOT_USER_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": 1, "allow": "0", "deny": "1024"}'

# Remove overwrite
curl -s -X DELETE "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/channels/CHANNEL_ID/permissions/BOT_USER_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN"
```

## Reactions

### Add Reaction

```bash
curl -s -X PUT "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/channels/CHANNEL_ID/messages/MSG_ID/reactions/EMOJI/@me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN"
```

EMOJI is URL-encoded (e.g. `%F0%9F%91%8D` for 👍).

### Remove Reaction

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/channels/CHANNEL_ID/messages/MSG_ID/reactions/EMOJI/@me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN"
```

### Get Reactions

```bash
curl -s "$COVE_BASE/api/v10/channels/CHANNEL_ID/messages/MSG_ID/reactions/EMOJI" \
  -H "Authorization: Bot $COVE_TOKEN"
```

## Local Plugin Deployment

When plugin code (`packages/plugin`) changes, manually build + deploy:

```bash
# 1. Build
cd ~/cove/packages/plugin && pnpm run build

# 2. Backup + replace
cp ~/.openclaw/extensions/cove/dist/index.js ~/.openclaw/extensions/cove/dist/index.js.bak
cp dist/index.js ~/.openclaw/extensions/cove/dist/index.js

# 3. Restart gateway
openclaw gateway restart
```

Staging CI only updates the Azure Cove server, not the local OpenClaw plugin.

## Rules & Gotchas

- **Use `jq -nc` for JSON construction** — shell string interpolation in JSON is error-prone
- **Webhook messages don't need auth header** — token is in the URL
- **Cross-channel: no auto-return** — results must be explicitly sent back via webhook
- **cove.md is auto-injected** — bots see it every turn without manually reading
- **cove.md max 8KB for injection** — larger files are stored but not injected into context
- **File storage max 100KB** — per file limit
- **Filename regex** — must match `/^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9._-]{0,254}$/`
- **Bot permissions** — bots need VIEW_CHANNEL permission overwrite to access channel files/messages
- **WS events** — file changes broadcast CHANNEL_FILE_CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE via WebSocket
- **Plugin caches cove.md** — 60s TTL, invalidated on WS file events; changes may take up to 60s to take effect
- **Role hierarchy is king** — even with ADMINISTRATOR, you cannot manage roles above your position. Only guild owner is exempt.
- **New role permissions must be subset** — cannot create a role with permissions you don't have yourself
- **Managed roles** — bot-linked roles cannot be manually assigned/removed/deleted
